# Changelog

All notable changes to the Accessibility Agents project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [6.0.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Native Codex plugin distribution** with router skills, Codex custom subagents, lazy specialist references, and built-in extension manifests.
- **Codex web accessibility router** that starts `accessibility-lead`, selects relevant specialists, passes skill context, and falls back to root-session specialist dispatch when nested dispatch is unavailable.
- **Codex lifecycle hook guard** for UI work:
  - `UserPromptSubmit` injects the lead-plus-specialists dispatch requirement.
  - `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop` track lead and specialist lifecycle.
  - `PreToolUse` blocks UI edits until `accessibility-lead` starts.
  - `Stop` blocks final answers until the lead and required specialists complete.
- **Codex dispatch smoke test** (`scripts/codex-accessibility-dispatch-smoke.mjs`) with source checks and optional live verification that lead and specialists spawn and complete.
- **Built-in extension registry** for core, web, documents, markdown, GitHub, and developer-tools domains, using the same manifest structure intended for third-party extensions.
- **Extension marketplace groundwork** for reviewed community extensions, contributor-facing extension documentation, and private administrator review workflow separation.

### Changed

- **Universal installer Codex support** now installs the Codex plugin payload, router skills, custom subagents, built-in extensions, compatible model-stamped agents, plugin marketplace entry, and a single user-level hook guard in `~/.codex/hooks.json`.
- **Codex hook registration** now uses the installer-managed user-level hook path only, avoiding duplicate `UserPromptSubmit` context from plugin-bundled and user-level hook registration.
- **Codex subagent model handling** no longer hard-pins legacy role templates to `gpt-5`; installed Codex agents are stamped with the configured compatible model.
- **Release readiness** now includes Codex plugin structure validation and Codex accessibility dispatch source smoke checks.
- **Release consistency validation** now checks `manifest.json` alongside `plugin.yaml`, `gemini-extension.json`, and `mcp-server/package.json`.

### Fixed

- Fixed Codex sessions that loaded the web accessibility skill but continued locally without dispatching `accessibility-lead`.
- Fixed partial-dispatch behavior where Codex spawned the lead but finalized before specialist review completed.
- Fixed duplicate Codex hook context caused by registering the same hook through both the plugin manifest and `~/.codex/hooks.json`.
- Fixed Codex hook marker matching when subagent lifecycle events use child session or parent thread identifiers different from the parent edit hook.
- Fixed targeted ARIA review prompts such as "look for extraneous ARIA regions" not triggering the accessibility dispatch hook.
- Fixed overly broad specialist selection where targeted ARIA review language could fan out to the full web audit team.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **CI integrity guard workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci-integrity-guards.yml` validates workflow invariants, config/schema integrity, and documentation version pin freshness on every push and PR.
- **Guard scripts**:
  - `scripts/validate-workflow-invariants.mjs` - asserts CI job ordering and required steps
  - `scripts/validate-config-integrity.mjs` - verifies scan config templates against JSON schemas
  - `scripts/validate-doc-version-pins.mjs` - detects stale version references in documentation
  - `scripts/release-readiness-check.mjs` - aggregated pre-release check that runs all three validators
- **Playwright high-impact workflow**: `.github/workflows/playwright-high-impact-check.yml` adds runtime accessibility checks targeting the highest-severity failure classes.
- **Playwright high-impact runner**: `mcp-server/scripts/playwright-high-impact-check.mjs` scans at four viewports (320/768/1024/1440), checks keyboard trap heuristics, overflow, and touch targets, and outputs JSON and markdown artifacts.
- **Office/PDF/EPUB JSON schemas** under `.github/schemas/` (`office-config.schema.json`, `pdf-config.schema.json`, `epub-config.schema.json`) wired into all template files and VS Code `settings.json` for in-editor validation.
- **Branch hygiene workflow**: `.github/workflows/branch-hygiene-report.yml` reports stale long-lived release branches.
- **New guides**:
  - `docs/guides/playwright-high-impact-checks.md`
  - `docs/guides/ci-integrity-guards.md`
  - `docs/guides/release-communications-checklist.md`
- **Playwright integration doc**: `docs/tools/playwright-integration.md` covers setup, configuration, and CI integration patterns.

### Changed

- **PR template release checklist** expanded with version alignment, release notes structure, and action tag freshness checks.
- **Template schema references** for Office/PDF/EPUB profiles now point to local repository schema files.
- **Release communications checklist** updated to include CI integrity guard and branch hygiene steps.
- **Documentation refresh** across `README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`, and `prd.md` to cover new CI guard rails and high-impact Playwright checks.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Regression-only CI mode** for markdown scanner: `--regression` flag scopes the scan to files changed in the current git diff (`git diff --name-only <baseline-ref> -- "*.md" "*.mdx"`). Falls back to full scan when the ref is unavailable. Controlled via `A11Y_REGRESSION_MODE` env var and `regression_mode` workflow dispatch input.
- **SARIF upload to GitHub Code Scanning**: `a11y-check.yml` markdown-lint job now uploads SARIF findings to the Code Scanning UI via `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3` (category `markdown-accessibility`) in addition to storing it as a workflow artifact.
- **JSON schema validation for config files**: `loadConfig()` now calls `validateConfigSchema()` which emits `::warning` annotations for unknown top-level keys, wrong types on `ignoredDirs`, `maxIssuesPerRule`, `failOn`, `output`, and per-rule `enabled`/`severity` fields. Validation never throws and never blocks the scan.
- **JSON Schema definition**: `.github/schemas/markdown-config.schema.json` (JSON Schema draft-07) documenting all valid fields for `.a11y-markdown-config.json` with descriptions, types, and enums.
- **`$schema` reference** in `templates/markdown-config-moderate.json` pointing to the new schema for editor intellisense.
- **Markdown scanner unit tests**: `scripts/test-markdown-scanner.mjs` with 18 test cases covering clean file, missing alt, multi-H1, heading skip, ambiguous link, emoji heading, code-block skip, config rule disable, gate modes, SARIF output, front-matter skip, config schema warnings, and regression mode behavior.
- **Orchestrator validator integration tests**: `scripts/test-orchestrator-validator.mjs` with 25 tests verifying script existence, all 7 required orchestrators, non-empty specialist directory, passing exit code, Read patterns, and Task references.
- **Release consistency guard workflow**: `.github/workflows/release-consistency-guard.yml` detects version drift across `plugin.yaml`, `gemini-extension.json`, `mcp-server/package.json`, and `manifest.json` on every push/PR to main. Also errors when CHANGELOG lacks an entry for the current version.
- **Test steps in CI**: `validate-orchestrator-contracts.yml` now runs both test suites (`test-markdown-scanner.mjs` and `test-orchestrator-validator.mjs`) and triggers on changes to those scripts and the scanner itself.
- **VS Code JSON schema bindings**: `.vscode/settings.json` now maps `.a11y-markdown-config.json`, `.a11y-office-config.json`, and `.a11y-pdf-config.json` to their respective schemas for editor intellisense and validation.

### Changed

- **`a11y-check.yml` SARIF upload step** now has `continue-on-error: true` so a clean run (no SARIF file generated) does not fail CI.
- **Release consistency guard CHANGELOG check** promoted from warning to error: missing CHANGELOG entries now fail the workflow with `exit 1`.
- **`a11y-check.yml` `markdown-lint` job** now has `permissions: security-events: write, contents: read`, `fetch-depth: 2` for git diff support, and conditionally passes `--regression` when `A11Y_REGRESSION_MODE=true`.
- **`validate-orchestrator-contracts.yml`** workflow name updated and path triggers expanded to include both test scripts and the scanner file.
- **`runScannerRaw` helper** in `test-markdown-scanner.mjs` switched from `execSync` to `spawnSync` to capture stderr on successful (exit 0) runs, enabling config schema warning assertions.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Markdown scanner config support** via `.a11y-markdown-config.json` in `.github/scripts/markdown-a11y-lint.mjs` with per-rule enable/disable, severity overrides, ignore directory control, and configurable per-rule output limits.
- **SARIF export support** for markdown accessibility findings (`--format sarif|both`, `--output`) to enable machine-readable CI artifacts.
- **New template**: `templates/markdown-config-moderate.json` for fast adoption of markdown scanning defaults.
- **Orchestrator dispatch contract validator**: `scripts/validate-orchestrator-dispatch.js` to enforce required `Specialist Dispatch` sections and verify specialist file references exist.
- **New CI workflow**: `.github/workflows/validate-orchestrator-contracts.yml` to run dispatch contract validation on PRs and pushes.
- **New documentation guide**: `docs/guides/metadata-markup-conventions.md` defining recommended metadata and markup conventions for agents, skills, and instruction files.

### Changed

- **`a11y-check.yml` markdown lint job** now supports gate modes (`none|error|warning`) and output modes (`text|sarif|both`) through workflow dispatch inputs and repo variables (`A11Y_MARKDOWN_FAIL_ON`, `A11Y_MARKDOWN_FORMAT`).
- **`web-severity-scoring` skill** upgraded with v2 guidance: scoring profiles, calibration coefficients, confidence-drift guardrails, normalized trend metric, and recommended scoring metadata fields.
- **`docs/getting-started.md`** updated with markdown scanner config examples, CI gate mode behavior, and SARIF usage patterns.
- **`AGENTS.md`** expanded with recommended metadata frontmatter conventions for agents and skills, plus instruction markup conventions.
- **`README.md`** documentation index now includes the metadata and markup conventions guide.

### Fixed

- **Markdown lint CI resilience** improved by making scanner behavior configurable without code changes.
- **Orchestrator-specialist drift risk** reduced by adding CI-enforced dispatch contract validation.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

#### Claude Code Specialist Architecture (Resolves #111)

- **73 Claude Code specialists moved to `.claude/specialists/`** — On-demand specialists are no longer registered in the Claude Code schema, cutting per-turn schema serialization from ~12,000-16,000 tokens to ~1,500 tokens. Specialists are loaded at runtime via `Read` + `Task` dispatch when orchestrators need them.
- **Read+Task dispatch pattern** — All 7 `.claude/agents/` orchestrators now include a `## Specialist Dispatch` section documenting the two-step invocation pattern: read the specialist file body with `Read(".claude/specialists/<name>.md")`, then invoke `Task(description="<purpose>", prompt="<specialist_body>\n\n<task_context>")`.
- **`.claude/AGENTS.md` updated** — Two-directory structure (`agents/` for 7 registered orchestrators, `specialists/` for 73 on-demand files) is fully documented with rationale and usage examples.

#### New GitHub Skills

- **`severity-mapping` skill** — Canonical severity level definitions and cross-domain normalization for web, document, and markdown audits. Score impact ranges, WCAG conformance alignment, and cross-format normalization. Now used by both web-severity-scoring and report-generation flows.
- **25 skills synced to `.gemini/extensions/a11y-agents/skills/`** — Full Gemini CLI parity for all GitHub Copilot skill knowledge modules.

#### New Instruction Files

- **`agent-terminology.instructions.md`** — Glossary of agent-specific terminology applied to all `.md` and `.agent.md` files. Ensures consistent vocabulary (specialist vs. orchestrator, dispatch vs. invoke, etc.) across the entire agent library.

### Changed

#### Structural Fixes: All 80 `.github/agents/` Files

- Fixed all structural gaps identified by `scripts/validate-agents.js`: missing `tools:` fields, empty body sections, description length violations, and emoji in prose content.
- `accessibility-regression-detector.agent.md` — Added missing `## MCP Tools` separator and blank lines around lists.
- `document-accessibility-wizard.agent.md` — Filled empty `## Authoritative Sources` section, added blank lines around lists.
- All 7 instruction files (`.github/instructions/`) — Fixed MD001, MD022, MD031, MD032, and MD058 markdownlint violations.
- `.github/prompts/README.md` — Fixed all heading/table/fence blank-line errors (MD022, MD031, MD058).
- `.github/skills/markdown-accessibility/SKILL.md` — Fixed MD032 blank-line-around-list violation.
- `.github/skills/severity-mapping/SKILL.md` — Shortened description to spec-compliant under 200 characters.

### Fixed

- **All pre-commit checks pass** — 0 validator errors, 0 markdownlint errors, 0 warnings across 80/80 `.github/agents/` files.
- **Claude Code token cost** — Specialist migration resolves #111: schema serialization reduced from ~12-16k tokens/turn to ~1.5k tokens/turn.
- **GitHub Skills spec compliance** — All skill descriptions are under 200 characters per the agentskills.io specification.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

#### New Documentation

- **`docs/subagent-architecture.md`** — Comprehensive guide covering VS Code 1.113 agent orchestrator patterns, delegation rules, coordinator-worker architecture, explicit allowlisting validation, nested subagent policy (disabled by default), framework integration (Chat Customizations, Agent Debug Log, MCP compatibility), integration patterns for different platforms (Copilot, Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Codex), and troubleshooting guide for orchestration issues.
- **`docs/troubleshooting.md`** — Detailed troubleshooting guide covering MCP server issues (List Servers command, trust prompts, workspace vs profile configuration, version checking), agent configuration problems (agent picker, frontmatter syntax validation errors, coordinator allowlist validation), platform-specific debugging (Windows/macOS/Linux), performance optimization, and common accessibility workflow issues.

#### New Validation & CI Tools

- **Coordinator allowlist validation rule** — Added to `scripts/validate-agents.js`: agents using the 'agent' tool must now declare an explicit `agents:` frontmatter field listing which specialist agents they can invoke. This prevents unintended delegation and enforces the explicit coordinator-worker pattern.
- **`scripts/check-release-consistency.js`** — New CLI tool that verifies version alignment across all release manifests (CHANGELOG.md, plugin.yaml, mcp-server/package.json, gemini-extension.json). Returns zero exit code if all versions match, nonzero if drift detected. Used for pre-release validation and CI checks.
- **`.github/workflows/check-release-consistency.yml`** — GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs `check-release-consistency.js` on every push to main and pull request to main, catching version drift before merge.

### Changed

#### Documentation & Messaging

- Updated README.md with links to new `docs/subagent-architecture.md` and `docs/troubleshooting.md` in the documentation table for improved discoverability.
- Refreshed `manifest.json` timestamp to 2026-03-26 to reflect release date.
- Enhanced marketplace and setup guidance with explicit VS Code 1.113 baseline call-outs, including MCP server bridging to Copilot CLI and Claude agents, Chat Customizations editor support, nested subagent defaults, and Agent Debug Log enhancements.

#### Version Consistency

- Corrected `CHANGELOG.md` version entry from `## [4.50]` to `## [4.5.0]` to follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z format, not X.YZ).
- Updated all platform manifest versions (mcp-server/package.json, plugin.yaml, gemini-extension.json) from v4.0.0 to v4.5.0 for consistency.

#### Agent Orchestration & Validation

- Enhanced `scripts/validate-agents.js` with new coordinator allowlist validation rule that flags agents using the 'agent' tool without an `agents:` frontmatter field, ensuring explicit delegation constraints per 1.113 best practices.
- Reorganized reference documentation: moved AGENTS.md and code-review-standards.md from `.github/agents/` to `.github/` root directory to clarify that these are reference documents, not agent definitions.

### Fixed

- Fixed version drift across release manifests by implementing version consistency validation and automated CI checking to catch misalignment at the point of commit/push.
- Fixed agent validation to enforce coordinator allowlist pattern, preventing unintended nested subagent invocations that could exceed 1.113 depth limits.
- Fixed agent directory organization by moving non-agent reference documents (AGENTS.md, code-review-standards.md) out of the agents directory, reducing validator false positives and improving clarity.

## [4.5.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Replaced the experimental Codex plugin and marketplace path with a direct `codex-skills/` pack covering the full 80-skill catalog.
- Updated the Codex installers to copy skills directly into `.codex/skills/` or `~/.codex/skills/`.
- Added Codex setup documentation describing the plugin marketplace research, what worked in testing, and why direct skill installation is now the primary recommendation.

### Changed

- Updated Codex setup docs to make the direct skills-pack install the primary Codex distribution path.
- Simplified experimental Codex role messaging so the optional TOML role layer no longer references the removed `.codex/AGENTS.md` baseline.

### Removed

- Removed the repo-local Codex marketplace and plugin files from the primary distribution path.
- Removed the obsolete `.codex/AGENTS.md` baseline in favor of the direct Codex skills pack.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-03-24

### CLI And Modernization Additions

#### Enhanced Agent Validator (`scripts/validate-agents.js`)

- **Official tool alias table validation** — Tool names are now validated against the official GitHub Copilot custom-agents configuration reference. Covers all canonical tools (`execute`, `read`, `edit`, `search`, `agent`, `web`, `todo`) and their documented aliases (`shell`/`bash`/`powershell` → `execute`, `grep`/`glob` → `search`, `task` → `agent`, etc.)
- **VS Code qualified tool validation** — Validates `toolSet/toolName` patterns (`edit/createFile`, `search/codebase`, `execute/runInTerminal`, `web/fetch`, etc.) against the complete VS Code built-in tool list
- **MCP namespace pattern validation** — Validates `<server>/*` and `<server>/<tool>` patterns, flags unknown MCP server namespaces with info-level messages
- **Frontmatter property validation** — All YAML frontmatter keys are validated against the official schema (`name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `target`, `user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`, `handoffs`, `agents`, `hooks`, `mcp-servers`, `metadata`, `argument-hint`). Unknown properties are flagged.
- **Deprecated property detection** — `infer:` flagged with migration guidance to `user-invocable` + `disable-model-invocation`
- **`target` value validation** — Validates against `vscode` and `github-copilot`
- **Boolean property validation** — Ensures `user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`, and `infer` are `true` or `false`
- **Conflicting property detection** — Warns when `infer` coexists with its replacement properties
- **Prompt body size check** — Warns when prompt body exceeds 30,000 chars (GitHub.com coding agent limit); skipped for `target: vscode` agents
- **Duplicate tool detection** — Flags duplicate entries in tools lists
- **Claude Code tool validation** — Validates Claude agents' tools including `MCP(...)` wrapper syntax and `GitHub` built-in tool
- **Claude Code plugin agents** — Now scans `claude-code-plugin/agents/` in addition to `.claude/agents/`
- **`--strict` flag** — Treats warnings as errors (exit code 1 on any warning). Used by pre-commit hook and CI.
- **`--quiet` flag** — Suppresses warnings and info, shows only errors
- **`--files` flag** — Validates specific files only (for pre-commit hooks), avoids scanning all 265+ files on every commit

#### Pre-commit Hook

- **`scripts/pre-commit`** — Git pre-commit hook that validates only staged agent/skill files before allowing commit. Runs in `--strict` mode to block commits with validation warnings. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify`.
- **`scripts/install-hooks.js`** — Cross-platform hook installer. Backs up any existing pre-commit hook before installing. Run `node scripts/install-hooks.js` after cloning.

#### CI/CD

- **Strict CI validation** — `validate-agents.yml` workflow now runs with `--strict` flag
- **Extended trigger paths** — CI workflow now triggers on `claude-code-plugin/agents/**` changes

#### Installer improvements

- **MCP server dependency installation** — `install.ps1` and `install.sh` now auto-install MCP server npm dependencies when Node.js is available
- **`update.ps1` / `update.sh`** — Updated with MCP dependency handling

#### Documentation

- **MCP Server setup guide** — Added setup instructions, tool reference table, and troubleshooting to `docs/getting-started.md`

### Fixed

- **`user-invokable` → `user-invocable`** — Fixed typo in 16 agent files (property name and description text) that caused the property to be silently ignored by Copilot
- **Removed deprecated `infer: true`** — Removed from 16 agent files. The default behavior (`user-invocable: true`, `disable-model-invocation: false`) is equivalent to `infer: true`, so no behavioral change.
- **Duplicate `search` tool in `repo-manager`** — Removed duplicate entry from tools list
- **Oversized prompt bodies** — Added `target: vscode` to 5 agents (`document-accessibility-wizard`, `daily-briefing`, `issue-tracker`, `pr-review`, `web-accessibility-wizard`) whose prompt bodies exceed GitHub.com's 30,000 character limit. These agents are designed for VS Code and use large inlined skill content.
- **Broken links** — Repaired broken URLs and hardened verification (from v4.0.0 follow-up)

### Fixed

- **`fix_document_headings` MCP tool** — Was reading raw .docx bytes as UTF-8 string, which fails because .docx files are ZIP archives. Fixed to use `parseZipCd()` + `getZipXml()` to properly extract `word/document.xml` from the OOXML ZIP archive before regex matching.
- **MCP server test suite** — Added 4 missing tools (`fix_document_metadata`, `fix_document_headings`, `check_audit_cache`, `update_audit_cache`) to the `registers all expected tools` test. All 52 tests pass.
- **Markdownlint compliance** — Full markdownlint pass across all markdown files in the repository, fixing heading levels, list formatting, and trailing whitespace.
- **MCP server dependency installation** — MCP server dependencies are now installed automatically during setup, preventing missing-module errors on first run.
- **Installer manifest initialization** — Fixed `install.sh` to initialize the manifest helper function before the Codex install path, preventing undefined-function errors.
- **wxPython `SetName()` misuse** — Replaced incorrect `SetName()` calls on wxPython controls with `StaticText` labels for proper NVDA and VoiceOver screen reader announcement.
- **USER_GUIDE completeness** — Fixed coverage gaps in `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` — added missing `office-remediator` agent entry, `css-accessibility` and `document-generation` instructions, `office-remediation` skill, and 17 prompts not listed in any prompt table.
- **Stale counts and team members** — Fixed outdated agent/tool counts and added missing team member entries across multiple documentation files. Expanded `.gitignore` for common editor and OS artifacts.

  - Use cases: Document audits (100+ files), web wizard audits (10+ minutes), GitHub briefings, cross-page analysis
  - Accessibility benefit: Screen reader audio signals prevent missed questions during context switches
  - Step-by-step configuration instructions for VS Code users

- **AI Co-Author Attribution** - Transparency for AI contributions to accessibility code
  - `docs/getting-started.md` - New "AI Co-Author Attribution" section with recommended git settings
  - Setting documented: `git.addAICoAuthor` with options `chatAndAgent`, `all`, `never`

- **Inline Chat Session Continuity** - Agent context flows seamlessly into inline edits
  - `docs/guides/context-management.md` - New "Inline Chat Session Continuity" section
  - Explains VS Code 1.110+ change: Inline chat now queues into existing session instead of isolated changes
  - Accessibility benefit: Inline fixes maintain full audit context, reference previous findings automatically
  - Example workflow: Full audit → inline fixes reference WCAG violations by number and severity
  - Best practice: Complete audit first, use inline chat for all subsequent fixes in same session

- **Collapsible Terminal Tool Calls** - Reduce visual noise from command output
  - `docs/guides/context-management.md` - New "Terminal Tool Calls are Collapsible" section
  - Explains VS Code 1.110+ feature: Terminal commands appear collapsed by default
  - When to expand: Troubleshooting failed commands, verifying file lists, checking CLI output, copying for reports
  - Agents that use terminal commands: document-accessibility-wizard, web-accessibility-wizard, github-hub, developer-hub
  - Reduces chat clutter for commands with long output (file discovery, scan results, API responses)

- **Custom Thinking Phrases** - Optional fun enhancement for accessibility-themed loading text
  - `README.md` - New "Optional Customization" section with "Custom Thinking Phrases" subsection
  - Setting documented: `chat.agent.thinking.phrases` with `append` or `replace` mode
  - Accessibility-themed phrases: "Checking contrast ratios...", "Testing with screen readers...", "Verifying keyboard navigation..."
  - Why it matters: Reinforces accessibility focus, reminds team members, makes wait time engaging
  - Step-by-step configuration instructions and community contribution invitation

- **Removed VS Code 1.110 Recommendations File** - All recommendations implemented and documented
  - `docs/VS-CODE-1.110-RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Deleted after all features implemented
  - High priority features (4 items): Completed in Phase 5
  - Medium priority features (6 items): Completed in Phase 6
  - Low priority features (3 items): Documented as skip or deferred to v3.2
  - All implementation work now tracked in CHANGELOG.md and prd.md

### Changed

  - `vscode-extension/package.json` and `package-lock.json` → 3.0.0
  - `desktop-extension/package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `manifest.json` → 3.0.0
  - Installer comments updated from "v2.5 → v2.6" to "v2.x → v3.0"
  - README community contribution example updated to v3.0

- **Agent Credibility** - All agents now ground recommendations in published standards instead of "AI-generated" advice
  - Every agent includes `## Authoritative Sources` section with inline citations
  - Source tiers clearly documented in CITATION_POLICY.md
  - Weekly currency check ensures sources remain accessible and unchanged

- **Documentation Architecture** - Professional packaging for enterprise distribution
  - `prd.md` now single source of truth for v3.0 implementation status
  - Removed `PLAN.md` (strategic planning document - content migrated to prd.md)
  - Added `MIGRATION-AUDIT.md` documenting content migration
  - Added `v3.0 Release Management` section in prd.md with testing checklists, success metrics, version history

- **System Requirements Documentation** - Critical version currency warnings across all documentation entry points
  - `README.md` - New "System Requirements" section (88+ lines) with tool version table, 5 reasons why currency matters, update workflows
  - `docs/getting-started.md` - Version currency WARNING boxes in all 5 platform prerequisites (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI)
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` - New "Testing Requirements" section requiring contributors test with latest tool versions before PRs
  - Version check commands documented for all platforms and tools
  - "Why Version Currency Matters" explanations: platform API changes, accessibility features, bug fixes, security, WCAG evolution

### Fixed

- **Trust Gap** - Users can now verify agent recommendations by following inline citations to official documentation
- **Context Budget Exhaustion** - Orchestrator agents now guide users to compact long audits before hitting limits
- **Accessibility Bypassing** - Lifecycle hooks enforce review before UI file edits
- **Manual Fix Verification** - Browser tools automate verification of accessibility fixes

### Performance

- **Hook Timeouts** - All hooks complete in <5 seconds (session-start: 10s)
- **Browser Tool Degradation** - Gracefully falls back to code review when browser unavailable
- **Source Currency Check** - Automated weekly (configurable to monthly/quarterly for stable sources)
