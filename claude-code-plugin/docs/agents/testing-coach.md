# testing-coach - How to Test Accessibility

> Teaches you how to test what the other agents built. Provides screen reader commands (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS, Narrator, TalkBack), keyboard testing workflows, automated testing setup (axe-core, Playwright, Pa11y, Lighthouse), browser DevTools accessibility features, and test plan templates.

## When to Use It

- You have built a component and need to verify it actually works in a screen reader
- Setting up automated accessibility tests in CI
- Learning screen reader commands for manual testing
- Creating an accessibility test plan for a feature
- Choosing the right testing tool combination
- Understanding what automated testing catches vs what requires manual testing

## What It Does NOT Do

- Does not write product code - it teaches testing practices
- Does not replace manual testing (automated tools catch ~30% of issues)
- Does not guarantee compliance (testing reveals issues, not their absence)

## What It Covers

## Behavioral Constraints

<details>
<summary>Expand constraints</summary>

- Will always emphasize that automated testing catches only ~30% of issues - manual testing is required
- Recommends minimum viable testing as NVDA + Firefox and VoiceOver + Safari
- Will not write product feature code - only test code and test plans
- Provides exact key commands, not vague descriptions
