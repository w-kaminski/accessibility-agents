# nexus — Auto-Routing GitHub Orchestrator

> Auto-routing GitHub orchestrator — describe what you need and Nexus silently routes to the right specialist agent. Unlike GitHub Hub (which presents a menu), Nexus infers your intent from plain English and hands off immediately. Best for experienced users who know what they want.

## What This Agent Is For

Nexus serves the same purpose as GitHub Hub — routing you to the right GitHub specialist — but with a different interaction style. Where GitHub Hub presents menus and guides you step-by-step, Nexus infers your intent from natural language and hands off immediately without asking clarifying questions unless strictly necessary.

Use Nexus when:

- You know what you want and want to get there fast
- You prefer direct action over guided menus
- You want to issue commands in plain English without picking from lists
- You want the fastest possible path to the right specialist

Use **GitHub Hub** instead when:

- You are not sure what you need
- You want to explore options
- You are new to the GitHub Workflow team

## How to Launch It

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

```text
@nexus what should I work on?
@nexus review the PR from this morning
@nexus show security alerts for my-repo
@nexus help me manage team access
```

### Claude Code

```text
/nexus show me my open PRs
```

## How It Works

1. Nexus receives your plain English request
2. It silently analyzes intent — no confirmation menu
3. It routes immediately to the matching specialist with full context
4. The specialist takes over and completes your task
