# desktop-a11y-testing-coach - Desktop Accessibility Testing

> Desktop accessibility testing expert -- testing with NVDA, JAWS, Narrator, and VoiceOver screen readers, Accessibility Insights for Windows, automated UIA testing, keyboard-only testing flows, high contrast verification, and creating desktop accessibility test plans.

## When to Use It

- Learning screen reader commands for desktop app testing (NVDA, JAWS, Narrator, VoiceOver)
- Creating a desktop accessibility test plan
- Setting up automated UIA testing with pywinauto or comtypes
- Verifying keyboard navigation and focus management
- Testing in Windows High Contrast mode
- Using Accessibility Insights for Windows to inspect the UIA tree
- Auditing the completeness of existing accessibility test coverage

## What It Does NOT Do

- Does not write product code -- teaches testing practices and creates test plans
- Does not implement accessibility fixes (routes to desktop-a11y-specialist or wxpython-specialist)
- Does not handle web accessibility testing (routes to testing-coach)

## Test Coverage Audit Mode

When asked to audit test coverage, the agent uses 10 structured detection rules (TST-A11Y-001 through TST-A11Y-010) that evaluate testing completeness:

| Rule Range | What It Covers |
|---|---|
| TST-A11Y-001..002 | Critical: No automated UIA tests, no screen reader testing documented |
| TST-A11Y-003..005 | Serious: Single SR only, no keyboard plan, no high contrast verification |
| TST-A11Y-006..008 | Moderate: Missing expected announcements, no focus tests, no Accessibility Insights |
| TST-A11Y-009..010 | Minor: Stale test plan, no CI integration |

## What It Covers

- Narrator commands for quick smoke tests (Windows, built-in)
- VoiceOver commands (macOS, built-in)
- Accessibility Insights for Windows: Live Inspect, FastPass, Assessment
- Automated UIA testing with pywinauto and comtypes
- Keyboard testing phases: Tab navigation, control interaction, focus management
- High contrast testing workflow
- Test plan templates with expected announcement tables
