# media-accessibility — Media Accessibility Specialist

> Audits video, audio, and streaming media for accessibility. Covers captions (WebVTT, SRT, TTML), audio descriptions, transcripts, accessible media player controls, live captioning, and WCAG 1.2.x time-based media criteria.

## Features

- Audits prerecorded video for synchronized captions (WCAG 1.2.2)
- Checks live media for real-time captions (WCAG 1.2.4)
- Validates audio description availability for video content (WCAG 1.2.3, 1.2.5)
- Reviews transcript availability for audio-only and video content (WCAG 1.2.1)
- Audits media player controls for keyboard accessibility and ARIA patterns
- Validates caption file syntax and quality (WebVTT, SRT, TTML formats)
- Checks caption timing, accuracy, and speaker identification

## When to Use It

- Adding video or audio content to a web page
- Reviewing captions for accuracy, timing, and formatting
- Checking media player controls for keyboard and screen reader accessibility
- Ensuring audio descriptions are available for visual-only information in videos
- Auditing live streaming for real-time captioning support

## How It Works

1. **Media inventory** - Finds all `<video>`, `<audio>`, and embedded media on the page
2. **Caption audit** - Checks for `<track kind="captions">`, validates caption file syntax, and reviews quality
3. **Audio description audit** - Verifies audio descriptions exist for video content with visual-only information
4. **Transcript audit** - Checks for linked or adjacent transcripts for all media
5. **Player controls audit** - Reviews media player for keyboard operation, ARIA labels, and focus management
6. **Live media check** - Validates real-time captioning integration for live streams
