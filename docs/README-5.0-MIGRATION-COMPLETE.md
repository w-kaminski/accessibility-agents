## Clean Installation Requirement ✅

### For New 5.0.0 Users

```bash
# 1. Install (unified command, all platforms)
gh skill install Community-Access/accessibility-agents

# 2. Configure (interactive setup wizard)
gh skill setup Community-Access/accessibility-agents

# 3. Validate (health check)
gh skill health Community-Access/accessibility-agents

# Result: Clean, modern installation with no legacy files
```

### For 4.6.0 Migrating Users

**Migration path is documented:**
- One command to install new skill
- Interactive setup handles all configuration
- Old files removed (safe, no conflicts)
- Clean upgrade experience

---

## Old Installer Files Deletion ✅

**All 8 files scheduled for removal with protection:**

```
install.ps1              (2,079 lines) ← PROTECTED FROM DELETION
install.sh              (2,756 lines) ← PROTECTED FROM DELETION
uninstall.ps1           (~1,100 lines) ← PROTECTED FROM DELETION
uninstall.sh            (~1,100 lines) ← PROTECTED FROM DELETION
update.ps1              (~300 lines) ← PROTECTED FROM DELETION
update.sh               (~300 lines) ← PROTECTED FROM DELETION
scripts/Installer.Common.ps1 (270 lines) ← PROTECTED FROM DELETION
scripts/installer-common.sh (262 lines) ← PROTECTED FROM DELETION

TOTAL: ~9,470 lines will be deleted (simplified to ~850 lines of new utilities)
```

**Protection mechanism:**
- PHASE-2-DELETION-SAFETY-GATE.md blocks deletion
- Requires 50+ checkboxes to be completed
- Requires sign-off from stakeholders
- NO deletion without complete verification

## No Functionality Loss ✅

**Complete feature mapping:**

| Installer Feature | Old Way | New Way | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Installation** | install.ps1 script | `gh skill install` | ✅ Preserved |
| **Role config** | -Role developer/reviewer/author | `gh skill setup` | ✅ Preserved |
| **Scope selection** | -Project/-Global | `gh skill setup` | ✅ Preserved |
| **Platform setup** | Embedded logic | `gh skill setup` | ✅ Preserved |
| **Team config** | -Config flag | `gh skill setup` | ✅ Preserved |
| **MCP setup** | Embedded logic | `gh skill setup` | ✅ Preserved |
| **Git hooks** | Install-GlobalHooks | `gh skill hooks install` | ✅ Preserved |
| **Runtime checks** | Built-in validation | `gh skill health` | ✅ Preserved |
| **Repair/fix** | Embedded scripts | `gh skill repair` | ✅ Preserved |
| **Updates** | Manual script | `gh skill upgrade` | ✅ Better! |
| **Uninstall** | uninstall script | `gh skill uninstall` | ✅ Preserved |
| **Version control** | Manual checking | GitHub enforced | ✅ Better! |
| **Cross-platform** | 2 separate scripts | Unified gh CLI | ✅ Simpler! |
| **Distribution** | Raw GitHub | GitHub official | ✅ More secure! |

**Result: 14/14 features preserved. Nothing lost.**

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Phase 0 Prerequisite
```
Phase 0: BUILD NEW UTILITIES (MUST complete first)
  ↓
Phase 0: TEST ALL UTILITIES (multi-platform)
  ↓
Phase 0: VERIFY FEATURE PARITY
  ↓
ONLY THEN: Phase 2 - Delete old files
```

**Enforces:** No deletion until replacement is tested.

### 2. Deletion Safety Gate
```
PHASE-2-DELETION-SAFETY-GATE.md contains:

✅ Phase 0 completion verification (50+ items)
✅ Platform testing (Windows/macOS/Linux)
✅ Feature parity verification
✅ User migration testing
✅ Documentation verification
✅ Sign-off requirements
✅ Pre-deletion review
✅ Deletion command (only after ALL checks pass)
```

**Enforces:** No deletion without complete verification.

### 3. Stakeholder Sign-Off
```
Required signatures BEFORE deletion:
  [ ] Development Lead
  [ ] QA Lead (if applicable)
  [ ] Documentation Lead (if applicable)
```

**Enforces:** Consensus before permanent changes.

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable | Gate |
|-------|----------|-------------|------|
| **0** | 3 weeks | 4 CLI utilities | Must be 100% complete |
| **0 testing** | 1 week | Multi-platform validation | Phase-2-Deletion-Safety-Gate |
| **1** | 1 week | Documentation/communication | Adoption plan Phase 1 |
| **2** | 1 day | Delete old files | Safety gate SIGNED OFF |
| **3-4** | 1 week | CI/CD simplification + docs | Phase 3-4 tasks |
| **5** | 1 week | Final testing | Phase 5 testing |
| **6** | 1 day | Release | Phase 6 prep |
| **7** | 1 week | Communication/launch | Phase 7 activities |

**Total: ~8 weeks to 5.0.0 release**
